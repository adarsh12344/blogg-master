        Avatar: The Way of Water is a 2022 American epic science fiction film directed and produced by James Cameron,
        who co-wrote the screenplay with Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver from a story the trio wrote with Josh Friedman and
        Shane Salerno. Distributed by 20th Century Studios, it is the sequel to Avatar (2009) and the second installment
        in the Avatar film series. Cast members Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, Stephen Lang, Joel David Moore, CCH
        Pounder, Giovanni Ribisi, Dileep Rao, and Matt Gerald reprise their roles from the original film, with Sigourney
        Weaver returning in an additional role.[6] New cast members include Kate Winslet, Cliff Curtis, Edie Falco, and
        Jemaine Clement. In the film, Na'vi Jake Sully (Worthington) and his family, under renewed human threat, seek
        refuge with the Metkayina clan of Pandora.

        Cameron stated in 2006 that he would like to make sequels to Avatar if it was successful, and he announced the
        first two sequels in 2010, following the widespread success of the first film, with the first sequel aiming for
        a 2014 release.[7][8] However, the addition of two more sequels, for a total of five Avatar films, and the
        necessity to develop new technology in order to film performance capture scenes underwater, a feat never
        accomplished before, led to significant delays to allow the crew more time to work on the writing,
        preproduction, and visual effects.[9] The filming process, which occurred simultaneously with a currently
        untitled third film, began in Manhattan Beach, California, on August 15, 2017. The filming location moved to
        Wellington, New Zealand, on September 25, 2017, and concluded in late September 2020 after three years of
        shooting. With an estimated budget of $350–460 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.[2][3]

        Following repeated delays in the expected release schedule, Avatar: The Way of Water premiered in London on
        December 6, 2022, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 16, 2022. The film received
        generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film for its visual effects and technical achievements
        but criticized the plot and lengthy runtime.[10] The film has grossed over $1.928 billion worldwide, becoming
        the highest-grossing film of 2022 and of the COVID-19 pandemic era, as well as the sixth-highest-grossing film
        of all time. The film also received numerous accolades, including nominations for Best Motion Picture – Drama
        and Best Director at the 80th Golden Globe Awards.

        Plot
        Fourteen years after the Na'vi repelled the human invasion of Pandora by the Resources Development
        Administration (RDA),[a] Jake Sully lives as chief of the Omaticaya clan, and raises a family with Neytiri,
        which includes sons Neteyam and Lo'ak, daughter Tuk, and an adopted daughter Kiri (born from Grace Augustine's
        inert avatar). His children are inseparable from Spider, the Pandora-born human son of the late Colonel Miles
        Quaritch. To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA returns to prepare Pandora for human colonization, as Earth is dying.
        Among the new arrivals are recombinants—Na'vi avatars implanted with the memories of deceased human
        soldiers—with Quaritch's recombinant serving as leader.

        One year later, Jake is leading a guerilla campaign against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission,
        Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, but Spider remains
        captured by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. After the RDA fails to torture Spider into divulging
        information, Quaritch decides to spend time with him to draw Spider on his side; in turn, Spider teaches
        Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language. Aware of the danger Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts poses to
        their safety, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omaticaya and retreat to the Metkayina reef-people
        clan at Pandora's eastern seaboard. Although Jake and his family are given refuge, their human heritage is
        viewed with antipathy by some. Nevertheless, the family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a
        spiritual bond with the sea, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of chief Tonowari and his wife Ronal.

        Lo'ak gets into a fight with Tsireya's brother Aonung. After he apologizes at Jake's insistence, Aonung and his
        friends entice him to a trip into the territory of a dangerous sea predator and leave him stranded. Lo'ak is
        saved and befriended by Payakan, a Tulkun—an intelligent and pacifistic whale-like species whom the Metkayina
        consider their spiritual brethren. Upon his return, Lo'ak wins Aonung's friendship by taking the blame for the
        trip, but is told that Payakan is an outcast among the Tulkun. Later, Kiri links to Metkayina's underwater
        Spirit Tree, and meets her biological mother Grace, whose consciousness lives within Pandora. However, Kiri
        suffers a seizure and falls unconscious. Jake summons Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help using their modern
        medical equipment; they diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot risk connecting to the Spirit Tree
        again. Although Kiri is saved by Ronal's intervention, Quaritch tracks Spellman and Patel's aircraft to the
        archipelago where the reef people live. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch commandeers a whaling vessel which
        hunts Tulkuns to extract an anti-aging serum called amrita. Quaritch's squad travels throughout the archipelago,
        brutally interrogating the tribes about Jake's location; when this proves fruitless, Quaritch orders the whalers
        to kill Tulkuns near the villages, knowing this will enrage the tribes and draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links
        with Payakan and learns that he was cast out because he went against the pacifist ways of his species and
        attacked the whalers who killed his mother, resulting in the deaths of many Tulkun and Na'vi.

        When the Metkayina learn of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak takes off to warn Payakan, followed by his siblings and
        friends. They find Payakan being hunted, and Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk are captured by Quaritch. Jake, Neytiri,
        and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans and rescue the kids. Quaritch forces Jake to surrender, but
        Payakan attacks the whalers, triggering a fight that kills most of the crew and cripples the whaling vessel.
        Neteyam rescues Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Spider, but is shot by Quaritch and succumbs to his wounds shortly after.
        Jake faces Quaritch, who uses Kiri as a hostage. When Neytiri does the same with Spider, Quaritch at first
        denies their relationship, but desists when Neytiri cuts Spider across the chest and raises her knife to kill
        him.

        Jake, Quaritch, Neytiri, and Tuk end up trapped inside the sinking vessel. Jake strangles Quaritch into
        unconsciousness and is rescued by Lo'ak and Payakan, while Kiri summons sea creatures to help her save Neytiri
        and Tuk. Spider rescues Quaritch, but refuses to go with him and instead rejoins Jake's family. After Neteyam's
        funeral, Jake informs Tonowari of his decision to leave the Metkayina. Tonowari, however, respectfully
        identifies him as part of the clan and welcomes his family to stay. Jakes accepts, affirming his family as sea
        people, and vowing to resume his campaign against the RDA.

        Cast

        From left to right: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldaña, James Cameron, Sigourney Weaver, and Stephen Lang at the press
        conference in Tokyo.
        Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former human, who fell in love with Neytiri and befriended the Na'vi after
        becoming a member of the Avatar Program, eventually taking their side in their conflict with humans and leading
        them to victory. He left his human body to permanently become Na'vi and is now chief of the Omaticaya.[11][12]
        Zoe Saldaña as Neytiri, daughter of the previous clan chief, future Tsahìk of the clan, and Jake's mate.[11][12]
        Sigourney Weaver as Kiri te Suli Kireysi'ite, the 14-year-old daughter of Dr. Grace Augustine's Na'vi avatar who
        was adopted by Jake and Neytiri.[13] Weaver originally appeared in the first film as Dr. Grace Augustine.
        Although both Weaver and Cameron confirmed that she would return in the sequels, she stated in 2014 that she
        would not play the same character.[6][14][15] Like most of the cast, she learned free-diving for the film and
        filmed scenes underwater.[16]
        Weaver also reprises her role as Dr. Grace Augustine, a human scientist who takes the side of the Na'vi and dies
        during the conflict. Her Na'vi avatar is revealed to have birthed Kiri despite her death. She appears in this
        film in a video recording and in a spiritual vision where she meets with Kiri.
        Stephen Lang as Colonel Miles Quaritch, a human military officer who led the paramilitary security division of
        the RDA in their conflict with the Na'vi.[17] After being killed by Neytiri in 2154, he is revived as a
        recombinant[17] and seeks revenge against Jake and his family. Cameron stated in 2010 that Lang would return in
        the first three sequels, stating, "I'm not going to say exactly how we're bringing him back, but it's a science
        fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really unexpected places across the arc of our new
        three-film saga."[18][19] He later stated that Quaritch would act as the main antagonist once again, in all four
        sequels.[20][21]
        Lang also reprises his role as the human version of Quaritch in a video recording made for his recombinant self.
        Kate Winslet as Ronal, a free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari's wife, who is pregnant.[22][23] Winslet
        called Ronal "a pivotal character in the ongoing story" but also "relatively small comparative to the lengthy
        shoot" since shooting all her scenes only took a month.[24] It marks her first time working with performance
        capture, and motion capture altogether. She, like most of the cast, also had to learn free diving for the film;
        while filming an underwater scene, she held her breath for over seven minutes, a new record for any film scene
        shot underwater.[24][25][26][16]
        Cliff Curtis as Tonowari, the chief of the Metkayina clan and Ronal's husband.[27][28][29]
        Joel David Moore as Dr. Norm Spellman, a former member of the Avatar Program who chose to side with the Na'vi in
        the first film.[30]
        Moore also portrays Spellman while in his Na'vi Avatar.
        CCH Pounder as Mo'at, the Omaticaya's Tsahìk, and Neytiri's mother.[31][32]
        Edie Falco as General Frances Ardmore, the commander in charge of the RDA's interests.[33]
        Brendan Cowell as Captain Mick Scoresby, the head of a private sector marine hunting vessel on the planet of
        Pandora.[34]
        Jemaine Clement as Dr. Ian Garvin, a marine biologist.[35]
        Jamie Flatters as Neteyam te Suli Tsyeyk'itan, Jake and Neytiri's 15-year-old son and oldest child.[36][37]
        Britain Dalton as Lo'ak te Suli Tsyeyk'itan, Jake and Neytiri's 14-year-old son.[36][37]
        Chloe Coleman as young Lo'ak.
        Trinity Jo-Li Bliss as Tuktirey "Tuk" te Suli Neytiri'ite, Jake and Neytiri's 8-year-old daughter and their
        youngest child.[36][37][38]
        Jack Champion as Miles Quaritch "Spider" Socorro, the teenage son of Quaritch born in Hell's Gate (the human
        base on Pandora in the first film) who was raised by scientists who stayed back on Pandora. He is inseparable
        from Jake and Neytiri's children.[36][37][39]
        Bailey Bass as Tsireya ("Reya"), a graceful and strong free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's
        daughter.[36][37]
        Filip Geljo as Aonung, a young male hunter and free diver of the Metkayina and Tonowari and Ronal's son.[36][37]
        Duane Evans, Jr. as Rotxo, a young male hunter and free-diver of the Metkayina.[36][37]
        Giovanni Ribisi as Parker Selfridge, the former corporate administrator for the RDA mining operation, who
        appears in a recording made for Quaritch's Recombinant.[40]
        Dileep Rao as Dr. Max Patel, a scientist who worked in the Avatar Program and came to support Jake's rebellion
        against the RDA in the first film.[41]
        Matt Gerald as Corporal Lyle Wainfleet, a human mercenary who fought and died in the RDA's battle against the
        Na'vi in 2154. Following the RDA's return to Pandora, he is revived as a recombinant and placed under Quaritch's
        command. Gerald was announced to reprise his role in August 2017.[29]
        Additionally, Alicia Vela-Bailey appears, uncredited, as Zdinarsk, a recombinant and member of the 1st Recom
        Squadron. Vela-Bailey previously portrayed Ikeyni, Saeyla, and a blonde woman in a bar in the original Avatar.
        She is also featured as a stunt performer in both films.[42][43] CJ Jones appears, also uncredited, as a
        Metkayina interpreter of the Na'vi sign language he created.[44]

        Production
        Development
        James Cameron speaking in 2010
        Director James Cameron in 2010
        In 2006, James Cameron stated that if Avatar (2009) was successful, he would consider making two sequels.[7] In
        2010, he said the sequels would proceed as planned as a result of the film's widespread success.[8] The sequels
        were originally scheduled for release in December 2014 and 2015.[9] He included certain scenes in the first film
        for future story follow-ups.[7][11] Cameron planned to shoot the sequels back-to-back and to begin work "once
        the novel is nailed down".[45] He stated that the sequels would widen the universe while exploring other moons
        of Polyphemus.[46] The first sequel would focus on the ocean of Pandora and also feature more of the
        rainforest.[47] He intended to capture footage for the sequel at the bottom of the Mariana Trench using a
        deepwater submersible.[48] In 2011, Cameron stated that he was just starting to design the ocean ecosystem of
        Pandora and the other worlds to be included in the story. The storyline, although continuing the environmental
        theme of the first film, would not be "strident" since the film will concentrate on entertainment.[49] The
        sequels were confirmed as continuing to follow the characters of Jake and Neytiri in December 2009.[12] Cameron
        implied that the humans would return as the antagonists of the story.[50] In 2011, Cameron stated his intention
        to film the sequels at a higher frame rate than the industry standard 24 frames per second, in order to add a
        heightened sense of reality.[51]

        In 2013, Cameron announced that the sequels would be filmed in New Zealand, with performance capture to take
        place in 2014. An agreement with the New Zealand government required at least one world premiere to be held in
        Wellington and at least NZ$500 million (approximately US$410 million at December 2013 exchange rates) to be
        spent on production activity in New Zealand, including live-action filming and visual effects. The New Zealand
        government announced it would raise its baseline tax rebate for filmmaking from 15% to 20%, with 25% available
        to international productions in some cases and 40% for New Zealand productions (as defined by section 18 of the
        New Zealand Film Commission Act 1978).[52][53]

        Cameron mentioned a possible third sequel for the first time in 2012; and was officially confirmed the following
        year.[54][55] Cameron was then looking to release Avatar 2 in 2015, but later that year, production was
        rescheduled for 2014, with the film to be released in December 2016, and to be followed by the two other sequels
        in 2017 and 2018.[56] By 2015, the scheduled release dates for the sequels were each delayed by another year,
        with the first sequel expected to be released in December 2017; this was due to the writing process, which
        Cameron called "a complex job".[57][58] The following month, Fox announced a further release delay.[59] In
        February 2016, production of the sequels was scheduled to begin in April 2016 in New Zealand.[60] In April 2016,
        Cameron announced at CinemaCon that there will be four Avatar sequels, all of which will be filmed
        simultaneously.[61] The four Avatar sequels share a $1 billion budget (e.g. $250 million each film).[62]

        New crew members include cinematographer Russell Carpenter, who worked with Cameron on True Lies (1994) and
        Titanic (1997), and Aashrita Kamath, who will act as art director on all four sequels.[63][64][65] Kirk Krack,
        founder of Performance Freediving International, worked as a free-diving trainer for the cast and crew for the
        underwater scenes.[66] Several creatures that were first introduced in the Walt Disney World theme park
        attraction Avatar Flight of Passage were featured in the film.[67]

        In 2019, after several media outlets shared rumors of potential titles for the Avatar sequels, including the
        name Avatar: The Way of Water, Cameron confirmed that the titles mentioned were "among titles that are in
        consideration" but had not been finalized at the time.[68]

        In 2022, Cameron said that about ten minutes of "gunplay action" were cut from the film as he was no longer
        inclined to "fetishize the gun", although he is known as an "action filmmaker".[69]

        Writing
        In 2012, Cameron stated that the sequels were being written as "separate stories that have an overall arc
        inclusive of the first film", with the second having a clear conclusion instead of a cliffhanger to the next
        film. Screenwriters were also announced: Josh Friedman for the first, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver for the
        second, and Shane Salerno for the third.[56] However, Friedman later clarified and stated that Jaffa and Silver
        were writing the first of the four sequels and he was writing the second.[70] In April 2014, Cameron expected to
        finish the (then) three scripts within six weeks, stating that all three sequels would be in production
        simultaneously and were still slated for December 2016 to 2018 releases.[71][72] He stated that although
        Friedman, Jaffa and Silver, and Salerno are each co-writing one sequel with him, they at first worked together
        on all three scripts: "I didn't assign each writer which film they were going to work on until the last day. I
        knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other
        movie."[56][73][74][18][70][75] Cameron added that they had "worked out every beat of the story across all three
        films so it all connects as one, sort of, three-film saga", a creative process that was inspired by his
        experiences in the writing room of his television series Dark Angel.[76] The writing took longer than expected,
        forcing Cameron to delay the release of the films further in 2015.[57]

        He spent a year writing and completing a full script for the first sequel titled Avatar: The High Ground, a
        130-page treatment and then threw it out and started over because "it didn't go enough into the unexpected,"
        which is one of the critical elements about sequels, according to Cameron. At one point he threatened to fire
        his writers because they would only focus on the new stories rather than first figuring out what made the
        original movie a success.[77][78] In December 2015, Cameron stated in an interview with Entertainment Weekly,
        saying "I'm in the process of doing another pass through all three scripts [...] Just refining. That's in
        parallel with the design process. The design process is very mature at this point. We've been designing for
        about a year and a half. All the characters, settings and creatures are all pretty much [set]."[79] On February
        11, 2017, Cameron announced that the writing of all four sequels was complete.[80] In a November 26 interview
        the same year, he estimated that the scripts had taken four years to write overall.[81] One element in The High
        Ground, showing an outer space battle between Na'vi, humans, and spaceships, was cut; this was later used in the
        prequel novel of the same name. Cameron cited the omission of the sequel's core aspects, which were
        insufficient, as reasons for the removal.[82][83]

        Comparing the themes of the sequels to the original, Cameron stated that "It will be a natural extension of all
        the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you're
        gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you're probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and
        you said later you hated it, you're probably gonna love these".[81] He later compared the sequels to The
        Godfather franchise (1972–1990), calling it "a generational family saga [...] It's a continuation of the same
        characters and about what happens when warriors, willing to go on suicide charges and leap off cliffs on to the
        backs of big orange Toruks, grow up and have their own kids. Now the kids are the change makers. It's
        interesting."[84]

        Discussing the character of Tuk in a February 2019 interview, Cameron mentioned that she was eight years old,
        and that the film would feature a scene between Jake and Neytiri taking place from Tuk's perspective: "There's a
        three-page argument scene between Jake and Neytiri, a marital dispute, very, very critical to the storyline. I
        wound up shooting it all from the point of view of the 8-year-old hiding under the structure and peeking in.
        Having gone through the experience with [Sam Worthington] on Avatar, I now knew how to write the Jake character
        going forward across the emotional rollercoaster of the next four movies."[38][85] In a December 2019 interview,
        Lang stated that his character was always meant to return in the sequels, as Cameron had shared with him "that
        Quaritch had a future" while shooting the original film.[86]

        Sigourney Weaver has stated that "The story is about family, about our families trying to stay together [and]
        the lengths to which we all go to protect each other and protect the place where we live. It's very much based
        on [James Cameron's] family and his joy in the family; and also, how vulnerable you are when you have
        children."[87] Cameron has stated that the film addresses the implications of Jake and Neytiri becoming parents
        in the time that elapsed since the first film.[88] Cameron stated:
        Becoming a parent changes so much of your behavior and your value system...What we saw in the first film were
        people who were fearless. Jake would throw himself off his ikran onto a leonopteryx (creatures featured in
        Avatar) but is a father of four going do that?...He's trying to keep his kids alive and trying to adjust his own
        life. Is he still a warrior? Are these young boys who are 14, 15, 16, coming up, getting all excited about
        wanting to go to war and fight for their people and for their land? How's [Jake] going to be a hypocrite and
        hold them back when he has to go do it?[88]

        RogerEbert.com critic Brian Tallerico notes that some of the themes in the film echo themes from earlier films
        directed by Cameron, including Titanic, Aliens (1986), The Abyss (1989), The Terminator (1984) and Terminator 2:
        Judgment Day (1991). For example, the film asks whether you should run and hide from a powerful enemy or fight
        their evil, similar to the Terminator films. The film also invokes themes of environmentalism and
        colonization.[89]

        Casting

        Producer Landau, Worthington, Saldaña, Cameron, Weaver and Lang in Tokyo, Japan during promotion of the film.
        Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldaña were confirmed in January 2010 to have signed on to reprise their roles in the
        sequels.[11] Later that year, Cameron confirmed that both Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang would return despite
        the demise of their characters.[18][14] Cameron also stated that Weaver would be featured in all three sequels
        (the fourth one was not planned at the time), and that her character, Grace Augustine, would be alive.[15] In
        March 2015, however, Weaver said that she will play a new character in the next film.[6] Cameron confirmed in
        2010 that Lang would return as Quaritch in the first three sequels, stating, "I'm not going to say exactly how
        we're bringing him back, but it's a science fiction story, after all. His character will evolve into really
        unexpected places across the arc of our new three-film saga."[18][19] In September 2015, Michelle Rodriguez
        stated that unlike Weaver and Lang, whose characters had also died in the first film, she would not return in
        Avatar 2.[90]

        Several new cast announcements were made in 2017, with Joel David Moore, CCH Pounder and Matt Gerald all
        confirmed to return from the first film.[31][32][29][30] Additionally, Cliff Curtis joined the cast as Tonowari,
        the leader of the Na'vi reef people clan of Metkayina.[27][29] On September 23, 2017, child actor Filip Geljo
        was revealed to have been signed in an undisclosed role.[91] On September 27, seven child actors were confirmed
        as a part of the main cast including Geljo: Jamie Flatters, Britain Dalton and Trinity Bliss as the children of
        Jake and Neytiri, Geljo, Bailey Bass, and Duane Evans Jr. as members of the Metkayina (together with Curtis),
        and Jack Champion, the only one to perform in live action, as a human born on Pandora.[36][37] Cameron later
        stated that the child cast had been trained for six months to prepare for the underwater scenes filmed in
        performance capture, and that they now could all hold their breath "in the two- to four-minute range", even
        then-seven-year-old Trinity Bliss, and were now "all perfectly capable of acting underwater, very calmly while
        holding their breath".[92][93]

        On October 3, 2017, it was reported that Kate Winslet, who starred in Cameron's Titanic, had joined the cast of
        Avatar 2, and possibly its sequels. Cameron commented, "Kate and I had been looking for something to do together
        for 20 years, since our collaboration on Titanic, which was one of the most rewarding of my career", and added
        that her character was named Ronal.[22][94][23] When asked by ComicBook.com on her reasons to return to work
        with Cameron, Winslet stated that he just asked her to play Ronal and she accepted out of a combination of her
        love for the first Avatar film, an attraction to the well-written and strong female role she was offered, a love
        for being on the water and to work with Cameron and the film's cast.[95] Although the nature of her character
        was originally unknown, Cameron stated the following month that Ronal was "part of the Sea People, the reef
        people", in reference to the Na'vi clan of Metkayina, making Avatar 2 Winslet's first role via performance
        capture, or motion capture altogether, which she was looking forward to; as she insisted on performing all her
        character's movements herself, she, like the child cast, had to learn free-diving for the film.[81][24] Winslet,
        who had been notoriously reluctant about working with Cameron again because of the complicated situations he
        puts his actors in for their scenes, stated that Cameron proposed the role to her in July 2017 when he came to
        help her and their fellow Titanic collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio at a fundraiser in France, sending her the
        scripts shortly after.[24] She commented that her role was "relatively small comparative to the lengthy shoot",
        as she would only have one month of shootings, but also "a pivotal character in the ongoing story".[24]

        On October 13, 2017, it was announced that Giovanni Ribisi would reprise his role of Parker Selfridge from the
        first film, in all four upcoming Avatar films.[40] On January 25, 2018, Dileep Rao was confirmed to return as
        Dr. Max Patel. A year later, Edie Falco and Brendan Cowell joined the cast in live-action roles.[33][34] In
        October 2019, Edward Norton revealed that he had turned down a role in Avatar 2, due to only being interested in
        playing a Na'vi, which his proposed character was not.[96]

        Filming
        Performance capture
        Avatar: The Way of Water entered production and started preliminary shooting on August 15, 2017, with Manhattan
        Beach, California, as the main shooting location.[97] Principal photography started on September 25, 2017,
        simultaneously with Avatar 3 (2024).[19][98][99] As Sigourney Weaver later revealed in November, filming had to
        be moved around to allow her to film a cameo appearance in the series eight finale of Doc Martin
        (2004–present).[100]

        On November 23, Cameron stated that the crew had been undergoing tests with the cast for the last month to film
        underwater scenes in performance capture, and that they succeeded in filming the first of those on November 14,
        featuring six of their seven main child actors, including Trinity Bliss.[81] He stated "we're getting really
        good data, beautiful character motion and great facial performance capture. We've basically cracked the
        code".[92][93] He said that tests would last until January 2018, as "we're still working in our small test tank.
        We graduate to our big tank in January".[92] It was "a dialogue scene", as according to Cameron, the characters
        communicate via "a kind of a sign language".[81]

        On April 30, 2018, Kate Winslet had "just a couple days" of shooting left to do.[101] While filming an
        underwater scene, Winslet held her breath for over seven minutes, breaking the record for longest breath held
        while shooting a film scene underwater, a record previously held by Tom Cruise for Mission: Impossible – Rogue
        Nation (2015).[16] In May 2018, Saldaña stated that filming was "kind of only halfway done" and that the crew is
        "about [to finish] motion capture production on the [second and third] movies, and then after that, they go
        straight into pre-production for the live-action part that would shoot for six months in New Zealand."[102]
        Saldaña finished shooting her scenes on June 8, for both Avatar 2 and its sequel, while Cameron stated around
        the same time that 130 days of performance capture had been shot.[25][26] On November 14, 2018, Cameron
        announced filming with the principal performance capture cast had been completed.[21]

        While part of the movie was shot at 24 frames per second, many fast scenes have been recorded at 48 frames per
        second. This allows fast objects still to be clearly visible while moving, while it was also claimed that too
        detailed view sometimes causes the viewer to see playing actors rather than story characters. The projector in
        the movie hall runs at 48 frames per second, for the 24 fps sections frames are duplicated.[103]

        Live-action
        In February 2019, Landau stated that live-action filming for Avatar 2 and 3 would commence in New Zealand in the
        spring of 2019.[104] Cameron confirmed later the same month that they had "only wrapped for [the motion capture
        parts]. Now, that is the vast majority of the characters and it is the vast majority of the running time of the
        film[s]. But that pesky little live action component is going to cost me five months of my life across the two
        movies."[105] Filming for 2019 concluded on November 29, to resume the following year in New
        Zealand.[106][107][108]

        On March 17, 2020, Landau announced that the filming of the Avatar sequel films in New Zealand had been
        postponed indefinitely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also confirmed that production would remain in
        Los Angeles.[109] However, virtual production continued in Manhattan Beach, California while visual effects
        continued at Weta Digital in Wellington.[110] In early May, health and safety production protocols had been
        endorsed by the New Zealand government, allowing filming to resume in the country.[111]

        On June 1, 2020, Landau posted a picture of himself and Cameron on Instagram, showing that they had returned to
        New Zealand to resume filming. After their arrival, Cameron and 55 other crew members who had traveled to New
        Zealand started a 2-week government-supervised isolation period at a hotel in Wellington before they would
        resume filming. This would make Avatar 2 and 3 the first major Hollywood blockbusters to resume production after
        postponing filming due to the pandemic.[112][113][114][115] On June 16, 2020, Cameron resumed filming and Landau
        posted a photo of his crew on Instagram filming the production.[116][117] The New Zealand production hired 46
        New Zealand cast members including Cliff Curtis (Tonowari) and Duane Evans Jr. (Roxto), 114 local stunt artists,
        almost 800 extras, and 36 apprentices and interns.[118][119] In September 2020, Cameron confirmed that live
        action filming in New Zealand had been completed, therefore completing the shooting of the film altogether after
        over three years; he estimated Avatar 3 to be "95%" completed, due to having live-action parts yet to be filmed
        outside of New Zealand.[120][121][122]

        In July 2022, the New Zealand Film Commission disclosed that the Avatar sequels had received over NZ$140 million
        worth of public funding through the country's Screen Production Grant. By comparison, The Hobbit trilogy
        (2012–2014) had received NZ$161 million in film subsidies. While ACT party deputy leader Brooke van Velden
        criticised the Government's film subsidy programme for allegedly taking public funding from other areas, the
        Economic Development and Regional Development Minister Stuart Nash argued that New Zealand's film subsidies for
        major Hollywood products brought much needed overseas investment and jobs to the New Zealand film industry.[123]
